### Docker
> Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
> Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.


#### Docker and Docker Compose
* Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers.
* Docker Compose is another Docker client, that lets you work with applications consisting of a set of containers.
* With Docker Compose you use a YAML configuration file to configure your applicationâ€™s services, and then you create and start all the services from your configuration with the Compose CLI.

    https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/services/#attributes


#### Dockerfile
* It all starts with a Dockerfile.
* A text file containing instructions for building your source code.


#### Docker Image
* Docker builds images by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile.
* A read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container.


#### Docker Container
* A runnable instance of an image.
* By default, a container is well isolated from other containers and its host machine.
* It is defined by its image as well as any configuration options you provide to it when you create or start it.


#### Docker Networking
* The following network drivers are available:
  * bridge  The default network driver.
  * host    Remove network isolation between the container and the Docker host.
  * none    Completely isolate a container from the host and other containers.

> In terms of Docker, a bridge network uses a software bridge which lets containers connected to the same bridge network communicate, while providing isolation from containers that aren't connected to that bridge network.


#### Difference between Containers and VMs
* Containers: Lightweight, share the host OS kernel, fast startup.
* VMs: Full OS virtualization, higher resource consumption.
* Docker Benefits:
  * Faster deployment.
  * Less resource-intensive.
  * Easier dependency management.
